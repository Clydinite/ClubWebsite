			Hello, I'm 郭彥均 (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/clydinite" class="underline"
				>@clydinite</a
			>), the creator of this tiny website. Let me provide you with some insights into its
			development. The website was constructed using the SvelteKit framework, a powerful tool for
			building web applications. SvelteKit simplifies the development process, enabling me to focus
			on creating a responsive interface. To style the website, I utilized Tailwind CSS, a
			widely-used CSS framework known for its utility-first approach, which helped me achieve a
			modern and clean design. Additionally, Flowbite was employed to enhance the user experience
			through the creation of UI components. For the font, I opted for JetBrains Mono, a
			developer-friendly typeface. JetBrains Mono is a monospaced font that promotes easy
			readability and is designed specifically for developers.
